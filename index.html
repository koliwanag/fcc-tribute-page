                    <p id="p1">Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci, commonly known as Leonardo da Vinci, was born on the  
                        <time datetime="1452-04-15">15th of April year 1452</time>. He was the illegitimate son of Piero da Vinci, 
                        a notary, and a peasant named Catarina. Little is known about da Vinci's early life and it has been a subject
                        of historical guesswork and assumption. He was an Italian polymath who had been a mathematician, scientist, 
                        inventor, engineer, astronomist, botanist, architect, anatomist, writer, sculptor,
                        and most famously, a painter. Da Vinci is regarded as the epitome of the "Renaissance Man", an individual
                        whose limitless curiosity and imagination is rivaled only by his incredibly inventive mind.</p>

                    <p id="quote">"Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen."</p>

                    <p id="p2">Although da Vinci had a vast area of interest and expertise, he is most famously known for his paintings and
                        he is in fact considered to be one of the greatest painters to have ever existed. The Mona Lisa and The Last Supper 
                        are his two most famous paintings, with the former considered to be the most valuable painting in existence and the latter
                        is the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Da Vinci's paintings have had such a massive cultural contribution
                        and influence which are rivaled only by Michelangelo's Creation of Adam.</p>

                    <p id="p3">One of da Vinci's painting, Salvator Mundi, is the most expensive painting to have ever been sold at $450.3 million.
                        Although not a painting, his drawing of the Vitruvian Man is considered to be one of the greatest cultural icon in 
                        history. It is heavily parodied and is reproduced in coins, shirts and books.</p>

                    <p id="p4">Leonardo da Vinci is also highly admired and respected for his techonological ingeniuty. He had conceptualised
                        a kind of an armored vehicle similar to a tank, a parachute, a flying machine, an adding machine like a calculator and 
                        he concentrated solar energy. While only a few of those were ever constructed or even feasible to construct during his time, 
                        some of his lesser known inventions have been manufactured, albeit unheralded, like the automated bobbin winder and 
                        a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire.</p>

                    <p id="p5">The vast extent of studies and research of da Vinci has greatly improved the state of knowledge in several fields of
                        science like astronomy, anatomy, civil engineering, optics and hydrodynamics. All these contributions to art, medicine and science
                        has made him to be regarded as the most intelligent and talented man to have ever lived. He truly was the "Renaissance Man".</p>
